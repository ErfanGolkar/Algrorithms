### Karatsuba Multiplication
### Merge Sort
### Count Inversions of a List
### Finding Closest Pair
### Strassen's Algorithm
strassen's algorithm is for matrix multiplication and has O(n^2.81) which is a significant improvement for large matrices.<br>
traditional matrix multiplication algorithm has O(n^3)
### Quick Sort
### RSelect & DSelect
### Simplex Algorithm
Simplex method is used to find the optimal solution for linear programming problems.<br>
the code provides maximum objective for now.
