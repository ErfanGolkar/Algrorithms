# Algrorithms
### Strassen's Algorithm
strassen's algorithm is for matrix multiplication and has \( O(n^2.81) \) which is a significant improvement for large matrices.<br>
traditional matrix multiplication algorithm has \( O(n^3) \)
### Simplex Algorithm
Simplex method is used to find the optimal solution for linear programming problems.<br>
the code provides maximum objective for now.
